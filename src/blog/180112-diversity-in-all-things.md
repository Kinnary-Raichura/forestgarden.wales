Two years ago, we planted a 90 metre windbreak hedge along the north boundary of the forest garden with a mix of four species:

* [Viburnum opulus](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=viburnum+opulus) (Guelder Rose)
* [Elaegnus umbellata](http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+umbellata) (Autumn Olive)
* [Hippophae rhamnoides](http://www.pfaf.org/User/plant.aspx?LatinName=Hippophae+rhamnoides) (Sea Buckthorn)
* [Amelanchier canadensis](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Amelanchier+canadensis) (Juneberry)

The biggest surprise is that the Elaegnus has done **really** badly, they’ve all pretty much died off. The Amelanchier has seen the most robust growth, now well over 2 metres high, and the Viburnum and Hippophae have done pretty well too.

I thought that it would be the Hippophae that would struggle the most with the wet soil but no, it’s perfectly happy.

What is strange is that a named variety of Elaegnus umbellata, 'Newgate' from [Agroforestry Trust](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/elaeagnus-umbellata-newgate/) which is just a bit further down the field has done really well – vibrant green shiny foliage and plenty of growth. Indeed, I’ve taken quite a few cuttings from it last autumn.

Over the next year, I really need to put a sheet mulch down between the hedge and the fence, as it’s starting to fill up with nettles, brambles and grass. Indeed, I now believe that most things in life benefit from a bit of mulching.
