* Don’t let roots dry out at all
* Not always necessary to water trees in -- how damp is soil?
* Rule of thumb: cut 1/3 off, no more
* Always cut to a bud or a branch
* Think of the pressure of the growth rising
* Watershoots
* Time scale
  1. First year watershoots
  2. Second year bud
  3. Third year fruit
* Bramley partic vigorous, leave watershoots for upward growth
* What you don’t want is **lollipopped tree**. This is where pruning done in a circle. Encourages shoots at the end
* Reclaim the centre of the tree. Recover its balance by pruning to create a central trunk again.
