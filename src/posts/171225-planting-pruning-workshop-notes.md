On 7th December, I had the good fortune to attend a free Planting & Pruning workshop, held by [The People’s Orchard](http://www.stdogmaelsabbey.org.uk/peoplesorchard) based [St Dogmaels Abbey](http://stdogmaelsabbey.org.uk/). It was run by Martin Hayes, an orchardist who works regularly for the [Gloucestershire Orchard Trust](https://glosorchards.org/home/), together with Nia and Sophie from The People’s Orchard. Martin was fantastic, as good with people as with trees, and I learnt a vast amount together with a dozen other volunteers.

As a beginner in everything, I made scribbly notes between wielding secateurs and taking documentary photos. What follows really is aide de memoire tamis for my own benefit.

I know a little about [rootstocks](), namely that different highly bred fruit (eg apples, pears, plums, cherries etc) are grafted on to different rootstock, which determines their vitality and height.

* MM106 & M25 don’t need staking
* rootstock reference
* Staking with fine-ish electric cable
* Photo of sketch
* Plant lead root windward
* MM106 24 feet approx
* Ian Sturrock nursery Bangor
* Don’t let roots dry out at all
* Not always necessary to water trees in -- how damp is soil?
* Rule of thumb: cut 1/3 off, no more
* Always cut to a bud or a branch
* Think of the pressure of the growth rising
* Watershoots
* Time scale
  1. First year watershoots
  2. Second year bud
  3. Third year fruit
* Bramley partic vigorous, leave watershoots for upward growth
* What you don’t want is **lollipopped tree**. This is where pruning done in a circle. Encourages shoots at the end
* Reclaim the centre of the tree. Recover its balance by pruning to create a central trunk again.
