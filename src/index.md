Welcome to our 8 acre forest garden in Ceredigion showcasing edible plants and trees. Everything we grow is entirely free of chemicals and we aim to produce 30% of the food required for a family of four and enough wood to heat our house.

##Â Why a forest garden?

* Plentiful, reliable and low maintenance food crops
* Biodiversity, shelter and increased wildlife
* Low energy, low input gardening
* Improved soil health and vitality
* Beautiful and functional
