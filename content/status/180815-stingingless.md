Received a packet of [sting-less Fen Nettle](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/the-lure-of-the-stinging-less-nettle/) seeds from [@BackyardLarder](https://mobile.twitter.com/BackyardLarder) for the #ForestGarden. Very excited! Apparently they require cold stratification, will be sowing them in a dedicated bed in autumn. Watch this rather slow space!
