A surfeit of Asturian Tree Cabbage seedlings from [The Real Seed Catalogue](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/cabbage.html). I think theyâ€™re going to be like collards but Iâ€™m not sure. Three in the ground already. If you want one, let me know and I will enter you in to the Amazing Asturian Tree Cabbage Prize Draw! (collection only ðŸ˜‰).
