Bore da byd, a hidden harvest in the #ForestGarden, mulberry [Morus alba x rubra 'Illinois Everbearing'](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/mulberry-morus-alba-x-rubra-illinois-everbearing/). Note the singular. One mulberry. So far. I’ll be moving the mulberry to the new forest garden, as it’s too exposed where it is and mulberry’s have fragile branches.
