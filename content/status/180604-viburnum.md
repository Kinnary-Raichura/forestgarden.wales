The [Amelanchier canadensis](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Amelanchier+canadensis) (Juneberry) have just finished flowering in the North Facde windbreak, and now the [Viburnum opulus](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus) (Guelder Rose) are flowering. They’re “cheap” hedging plants, and I can’t think of anything more beautiful.
