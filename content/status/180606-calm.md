It is the calm before the #ForestGarden talk. My first ever talk to a gardening club. Eek. [Drefach Felindre Gardening Club](http://www.drefachfelindregardeningclub.co.uk), tonight at 7.30pm. The photo is of “something magical” for a slide, it’s a hover fly on a [Valeriana officinalis](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Valeriana+officinalis) flower. Very soothing 🙂.
