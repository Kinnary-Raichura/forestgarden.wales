A #ForestGarden is all about the trees, and [Urban Forestry Network](http://urbanforestrynetwork.org/index.htm) handily [lists the benefits](http://urbanforestrynetwork.org/benefits/index.htm). Trees: 
* have aesthetic value and improve property values
* improve our air quality
* increase water retention and quality
* reduce energy costs
* provide habitat for wildlife
