Picked a bowlful of veg for a curry from the #ForestGarden, [Good King Henry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Chenopodium+bonus-henricus) leaves, [Welsh Onions](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Allium+fistulosum) and ['Cosse Violette' Purple Pole Bean](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/beans.html), in a homemade tomato pur√©e from [Grushkova](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/tomatoes_bush.html) bush tomatoes and spiced up with [Alberto's Locoto](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/hotpeppers.html) chillies. Today, I bulked the curry out with [Latah](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/tomatoes_bush.html) tomatoes and thickened the sauce with [Common Mallow](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=malva+sylvestris) leaves. The curry was fab.
