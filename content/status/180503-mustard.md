This is last year’s Sinapis alba (white mustard) #ForestGarden ground cover – thickly sown last summer, and it has given the strawberry and alefoot ([Fragaria viridis](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Fragaria+viridis) and [Glechoma hederacea](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Glechoma+hederacea)) a chance to get established. You can still bits of grass (middle left) but these are really easy to weed out.
