I’ve been propagating [Symphytum ibericum](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/75444/i-Symphytum-ibericum-i/Details) (Dwarf Comfrey) and [Vinca minor](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Vinca+minor) (Lesser Periwinkle) for the new Ornamental, Maintenance-free #ForestGarden. At 3 plants per square metre, that’s a lot of propagating.
