# Forest garden tours

We offer a 3 hour tour, presentation plus tea & biscuits for anyone interested in finding out more about forest gardening.

> Forest gardening is a productive and practical garden system using trees, shrubs and perennial plants, designed to be stable, sustainable and low-maintenance.

The tour concentrates on a 1 acre pasture field which we started 3 years ago and is about 2/3 completed. We’ve constructed a wildlife pond, polytunnel, propagation beds, compost bins and raised beds. We also visit the adjacent 1 acre field, site of the Ornamental Wildlife Forest Garden due to be started in early 2019, and discuss the planning stages, as well as a detour via a ½ acre mixed coppice.

The presentation is an introduction to forest gardening and a discussion of practical lessons learned. Tea & homemade biscuits will be offered part way through.

Please note, BOOKING IS ESSENTIAL. Also, at the very least, a mild interest in gardening is a prerequisite: the garden is in its early stages and indifferent individuals will only see twigs.

Price £10 per head, minimum 5 people. Discounts available for large groups.

Pre-booked tours on Tuesday, Wednesday & Friday, 10am-1pm, open from Easter to late Autumn.
