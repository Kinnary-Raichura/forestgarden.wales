The stinging nettle ([Urtica dioica]()) is an excellent forest garden plant. Before it flowers*, it makes a [fantastic soup]() , an excellent if strong-tasting spinach replacement, it makes [a nice beer](), it contains [buckets of iron](), oodles of [nitrogen](), it can be used as a nutritious [cut ‚Äòn‚Äô drop]() mulching material or made into a fertiliser tea, it‚Äôs the [main food for butterflies]() and a host of [other wildlife](), it‚Äôs easy to grow.

In short, what‚Äôs not to love? üòç

Oh. The sting. I always sting myself when collecting stinging nettles, no matter how long my gloves.

If it weren‚Äôt for the sting, we‚Äôd all be growing it [intentionally] in our gardens.

I had heard of a stinging-less sub-species, and thanks to the workings of the wonderful web, Wicken Fen National Trust confirmed its existence to me in a tweet [@WickenFenNT]().

Also, perennial vegetable suppliers [Backyard Larder]() said that they had some specimens and hoped to get some seed [@BackyardLarder]()

I am very excited about setting up a stinging-less nettle bed, effortless spring soups and nutritious summer mulching here we come‚Ä¶

*After it has flowered, apparently there is a build up in gritty particles called cysoliths, which can damage the kidneys if ingested.
