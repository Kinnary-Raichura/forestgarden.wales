After giving my [first ever forest garden talk](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/intro/#1) to [The People’s Orchard](https://www.facebook.com/peoplesorchardstdogs/), Nia asked if they could have tour of Forest Garden Wales own forest garden.

I hadn’t thought that people would be interested in a **developing** forest garden. We started planting canopy trees and windbreaks two years ago, and are about halfway through planting the ground cover and shrub layer. This time of year, all the trees look like sticks as well!

The feedback was really positive, so much so that we’ve decided to run forest garden tours from spring to autumn.
